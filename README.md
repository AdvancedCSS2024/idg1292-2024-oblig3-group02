# Project overview
The project is an interactive web experience that aims to raise awareness about the pollution, and environmental challenges of our oceans. It combines visually appealing graphics, animations and informative text to engage users and educate them about the importance of ocean conservation.

## Purpose
Raise awareness and bring attention though etos means. by trying to bring an emotion from the visitors of our page. We wanted to bring the question "is your luxury worth killing entire species?"

Inspire action by bringing attention to the future that may come. We realy leaned on some of the research we found that stated that "there may be more plastic in the ocean by 2050 than fish by weight"

## Brainstorming
We started off my talking about what goal we wanted and landed on 14 as we both thought it was an important point as it has not seen much progress and bringing awareness to it can help nudge us in the right direction.

we talked about how we wanted to do it and we thought a happy and fun website would not bring much attention to the goal. we wanted to make something darker and more direct. We landed on the idea of filling the ocean with more trash than fishes and having a diver in the future looking for fish but finding mostly trash. the idea was the deeper you go the more trash we will put on the screen and the darker it gets.

We wanted to try to use canvas as this would make our idea of making a "game" much much... much... easier but as we were unsure if we were allowed to do so we ended up using normal html elements and just making everything from scratch. this means all the triggers, all the logic for moving the player and everything else was made from scratch. since we wanted to use gsap somewhere we wanted to implement gsap and ended up using that for the sprite.

After this we started optimizing and removing styles and trying to make it more responsive and at the same time we ended up adding more trash. you can never have enough trash. i was planing on using JS to scatter the trash but we ended up just doing it by hand as with the js approach it may slow down page loading times as we are spawning a ton of elements on the screen.

## Implementation
GSAP, CSS keyframe animations, We made our own scripts for more or less everything. Triggering animations by using bounding box detection and then we refined it to point-in-rectangle testing.
